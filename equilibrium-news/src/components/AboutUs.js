          <p>The mission of Equilibrium News is to create a balanced news platform where users
              are exposed to various news sources on the topic of their choice. Our team knows 
              that in these politically turbulent times that it can be easy to become biased 
              to one side of the news. Equilibrium News hopes to serve those who want to change that.
